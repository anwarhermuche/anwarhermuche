## About Me

I am an AI Engineer with a background in Data Science and Computer Science (UFLA), currently focused on designing and deploying scalable AI systems powered by LLMs, RAG architectures and agent orchestration frameworks.

I began my professional journey in 2020 working with data analysis and machine learning for educational institutions in Brazil. Over time, I transitioned from building predictive models and analytics pipelines to engineering full AI platforms — including multi-agent systems, backend services, orchestration layers and production-grade AI infrastructure.

Today, I operate at the intersection of backend engineering, distributed systems and AI infrastructure, building systems that move from prototype to reliable production environments.
